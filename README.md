# Description

The service is coded in order to viasualise phenotypic similatiry network throught biological network. Its offer to users like clinician who belong to ERNs an interactive and user-friendly experience and can drive to diagnostic hypothesis. It's related to Solve rd project.
This is a portal for phenotipic similarity analysis, it will be deploy for clinicians and guide to diagnostics hypothesis.

Data are generated with python, visualization is done with JS with cytoscape JS. 
The data file formats are: tsv, json, xlsx, txt and so on.


## SolveRD projet
Solve rd project aim to helped through diagnostics hypothesis on unsolved patients with rare disease done by clinicians who belong to ERNs. WP1 contains unsolved and solved-rd cases data in a standardised way, unsolved one are related to the RD ontology RDCO. Orphanet develop a three steps workflow featuring with CNAG. Data visualisation of cases based on the three steps is settle thanks to biological network through cytoscape js library. This aims to code an interactive js platform. Explorations, analysis and filtration of genes, cases and Orphacodes drive to diagnostic hypothesis. Several options for filtration, analysis, exploration or exportation are available on the platform like edges score filtration, ERN section, build a sub-graph, json export and so on Here, we specifically present jamborees cases network based on step C1. Cytoscape js lead to easily explore data and it can be link to other databases like GO, WikiPathways and so on.

# /!\ Code to change  /!\
  -   R script *curation_excluding_redundant_terms_with_ontologyIndex.R*.
      -   Change the path of the variable : **folder**.
```
folder = "C:\\Users\\username\\...\\Freeze3\\output_5HPO\\curation_input\\"
setwd(folder)

input_json = "Freezes1_2_3_noduplicates_noparents_with_5phenotypes_complete\\"
output_json = "Freezes1_2_3_noduplicates_noparents_with_5phenotypes_aftercuration_complete\\"
```

  -   Python script *path_variable.py*.
      -   Change the path of the variable **PATH**. 
            -   PATH describes the location of the main file named Freeze3. All variables that store paths depend on the PATH variable.
            -   Exemple :
                  ```
                  PATH= r"C:\Users\username\Documents\Freeze3\\"
                  ```
      -   Change the path of the variable **PATH_R**. 
            -   PATH_R indicates where R is stored on the computer. It is necessary to modify it depending on the location of R and the OS use (window,linux or mac).
            -   Exemple : 
                  ```
                  PATH_R= r"C:\Program Files\R\R-4.2.1\bin\Rscript"
                  ```
                  
  - Python script *main.py*
      -   If needed uncomment the list.remove('__init__.py') part for all list. Sometime __init__.py is included on the list thus it should be removed, if it's not into the list to need to change the code.
           -   Exemple : 
                  ```
                  # files_all_step.remove('__init__.py') # uncomment if needed
                  ```  

 
 
# Getting started :
  -   Extract the project on docker [command ]  **WIP**
  -   Download the zip folder.
  -   The folder is called Freeze3 and contains the folders input (all the input files needed for the process), protocol curation (documentation) and script (containing the pyhton code).
  -   Go to the file named *a_script_curation/curation_excluding_redundant_terms_with_ontologyIndex.R* and change the path.
  -   Go to the file named *path_variable.py* and change the variable **PATH** put the actual path where the folder Freeze3 is.
  -   Go to the script folder and run the file main.py. 
  -   *main.py* execute all scripts on the right order. 
      - a) Filter and extract the phenopackets  of interest, run the curation on R with **OntologyIndex** and launch the RunsolveRD (phenopackets similarities score algorithm).
      - b) Set all genes. 
      - c) Lauch all steps.
      - d) Build for each phenopacket of each steps its sub-dataframe.
      - e) Generate the dataframes of each phenopacket of each step compatible with Cytoscape. Then add informations from **Wikipathway**.
      - f) From the dataframes, Cytoscape builds json files compatible with Cytoscape JS for the service. 
      - g) Folder that defines the homepage of the service from scratch.


# Note:
  -   Phenopackets are json files that describe HPO's of one patient.
  -   Cases is a synonym for phenopacket. Case is used to describe patients on the runsolveRD algorithm, the case-case similarity algorithm is run and or the case-ORPHAcode similarity algorithm is run. Cases also describe unsolved or solved patients.
